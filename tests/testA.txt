// Test A — Basic Commit, No Failures
// Test A: Simple write and commit, no failures
begin(T1)
R(T1, x1)
W(T1, x2, 999)
end(T1)
dump()

// Expected Behavior:
// T1 begins at time 1.
// R(T1, x1) reads the initial snapshot of x1 = 10 from its home site.
// W(T1, x2, 999) buffers a write to replicated variable x2 on all up sites.
// end(T1) passes FCW and available-copies rules (no other writers, no failures), so T1 commits.
// dump() prints all sites:
// All copies of x2 should now be 999.
// All other variables remain at their initial values.
