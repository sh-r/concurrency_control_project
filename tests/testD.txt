// Test D: Read-Your-Own-Write (RYOW)
begin(T1)
W(T1, x5, 99)
R(T1, x5)
end(T1)
dump()

// Expected behavior:
// begin(T1) at time 1
// W(T1, x5, 99) buffered
// x5: 99                 <-- RYOW: must see its own buffered write
// end(T1) at time 4
// T1 commits
// dump() should show x5 = 99 at site 6 (home of x5) and the original values elsewhere unchanged.
