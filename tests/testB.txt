dump()

// Expected Behavior:
// T1 and T2 both start before any writes.
// Both buffer writes to x2.
// end(T1) runs first:
// No prior writer committed after T1.start_time, so T1 commits.
// x2 becomes 111 on all up sites; version history updated.
// end(T2):
// Sees that x2 was already written by T1 with commit_time > T2.start_time.
// FCW rule causes T2 to abort with reason “first-committer-wins on x2 vs T1”.
// dump() shows x2 = 111 at all sites; no trace of 222.
