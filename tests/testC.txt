// Test C — Simple Cycle Detection Scenario
// Test C: Read-write cycle leading to abort
begin(T1)
begin(T2)
R(T1, x2)
W(T2, x2, 222)
W(T1, x4, 444)
end(T2)
end(T1)


// Expected Behavior:
// T1 reads x2 (old value).
// T2 later writes x2 and tries to commit first.
// T1 writes x4 and attempts to commit after T2.
// There is a potential RW-cycle (T1 → T2 via read of x2, and T2 → T1 via overlapping writes / snapshot timelines).
// "cycle detected"
// Either T1 or T2 is aborted to break the cycle.
