Experiment 2 — MySQL (Clustered vs Non-Clustered vs No Index)
Dataset: 100,000 rows
Table design:
ssnum is the clustered index (PRIMARY KEY).
range_uniform is a uniformly scrambled version of ssnum.
range_skew is a skewed integer (0..100).
hot_col is a hotspot column: 1 for ~10% of rows, otherwise = ssnum.

# MySQL
##########################

S1: Range Query (Uniform Distribution) -> Query: ssnum BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000

Index Type	Duration (sec)
Clustered (ssnum)	0.00330
Non-clustered index (range_uniform)	0.00299
No Index	0.02128

Conclusion (S1):
Clustered and nonclustered have similar performance on uniform ranges.
No index is 7× slower.
The rule “clustered index helps range scans” is WEAK in uniform distribution.


S2: Point Query (Uniform Distribution) -> Query: ssnum = 50000

Index Type	Duration (sec)
Clustered	0.000175
Nonclustered	0.000267
No Index	0.02047

Conclusion (S2):
Clustered ≈ nonclustered (both extremely fast).
No index is 120× slower.
Point queries do not benefit from clustering → rule is WEAK here also.


S3: Range Query on Skewed Distribution (range_skew)

Scenario	Query	Time (sec)	Index Type
S3-Indexed	range_skew BETWEEN 10 AND 20	0.00345	Secondary index
S3-NoIndex	range_skew BETWEEN 10 AND 20	0.03432	No index

Key result:
Index is 10× faster even on a skewed distribution.
But compared to uniform distribution, the benefit is smaller because the index returns many rows per key, causing more leaf-page lookups.


S4: Multipoint Hotspot Query (hot_col = 1)

Scenario	Query	Time (sec)	Index Type
S4-Indexed	hot_col = 1	0.00238	Secondary index
S4-NoIndex	hot_col = 1	0.02234	No index

Key result:
Index is 9× faster for multipoint hotspot access.
But clustering on ssnum is irrelevant → hotspot column is not clustered.
You observe a moderate improvement, much smaller than uniform-point lookup (120×!).
This demonstrates a case where the clustered-index rule is “NOT strongly satisfied.”


##########################
# PostGRES
##########################

Dataset: 100,000 rows
Table design: ssnum plays the role of the “clustered-like” column.
Synthetic columns mirror MySQL:
range_uniform → uniform distribution
range_skew → skewed distribution
hot_col → hotspot distribution



S1 — Range Query (Uniform Distribution)

Query: BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000
Rows returned ≈ 10,001

Index Type	Query	Time
Clustered-like (index on ssnum)	ssnum BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000	4.006 ms
Nonclustered (index on range_uniform)	range_uniform BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000	2.101 ms
No Index (range_uniform)	range_uniform BETWEEN 10000 AND 20000	8.913 ms

Conclusion (S1 — uniform range)
Nonclustered index is faster than clustered-like (2.1 ms vs 4.0 ms).
No index is ~4× slower than indexed scans.
Therefore, the clustering advantage is weak under uniform distribution — same pattern as MySQL.


S2 — Point Query (Uniform Distribution)
Query: = 50000

Index Type	Query	Time
Clustered-like	ssnum = 50000	1.588 ms
Nonclustered	range_uniform = 50000	0.185 ms
No Index	range_uniform = 50000	7.962 ms

Conclusion (S2 — uniform point query)
Indexed point lookups are extremely fast regardless of index type → clustering is irrelevant, same as MySQL.
Nonclustered slightly wins here.
No index is ~40× slower.


S3 — Range Query (Skewed Distribution)

Query: range_skew BETWEEN 10 AND 20
Rows returned = 11,000

Scenario	Time
Indexed (range_skew)	2.595 ms
No Index	9.568 ms

Conclusion (S3 — skewed)
Index improves performance ~4×.
But improvement is smaller than uniform distribution, because the skew means each index key hits many rows → more leaf pages.
This matches the paper’s claim: clustering/indexing is less effective under skew.


S4 — Hotspot Multipoint Query

Query: hot_col = 1
Rows returned = 10,001

Scenario	Time
Indexed (hot_col)	3.701 ms
No Index	8.772 ms

Conclusion (S4 — hotspot)
Index is ~2.3× faster — an improvement, but not huge.
Clustering on ssnum does not help at all (hot_col is unrelated).
Same outcome as MySQL → clustering rule is weak for hotspots.
